=== WHAT IS FLAVORTOWN ===
Flavortown (flavortown.hackclub.com) is a Hack Club event where teenagers 13-18 make personal code projects, share them, and win free prizes based on quality. Runs until March 31, 2026. Beta started Dec 19, 2025, full launch Dec 22, 2025.

HOW TO EARN COOKIES (THE CURRENCY)
Cookies are the points/currency in Flavortown. Here's how users earn them:
1. TRACK TIME: Use Hackatime to track coding time on projects
2. SHIP PROJECTS: Submit completed projects to Flavortown
3. GET REVIEWED: Shipwrights (invite-only team) review the project
4. PEER VOTING: Other Hack Clubbers rate projects with up to 6 stars in 3 categories
5. EARN COOKIES: 
   - Base: minimum 1 cookie per hour tracked
   - Multiplier: up to 30x based on peer ratings (average is 10x)
   - Depends on: peer voting score + devlog hours
   - More hours = quality matters more (prevents low-effort spam)
6. SPEND: Use cookies in the shop for prizes

TIME TRACKING WITH HACKATIME 
- Users track time with Hackatime (compatible with Wakatime extensions)
- Must install Wakatime/Hackatime extension in their editor (VSCode, etc) or design tools (Figma, KiCad)
- Time takes a few minutes to appear the first time
- IMPORTANT: Must open project as folder (File > Open Folder in VSCode) to avoid "Unknown" project name
- Hackatime project name = folder name they have open
- Can create .wakatime-project file to customize name
- Chrome extension does NOT work (can't identify project)

COMMON PROBLEMS:
- Shows "Unknown": no folder open in editor, need File > Open Folder
- Shows "<<LAST_PROJECT>>": using incompatible program (Wakatime Desktop or Chrome). Must use editor-specific extension
- Check at: hackatime.hackclub.com/my/projects
- No extension for their editor: ask in #flavortown-help, or use wakapi-anyide/bashatime.sh (experimental)

HARDWARE PROJECTS:
- Trial timelapse tool counts for Hackatime but in development and may lose time
- Better to track design and firmware time with normal Hackatime

=== COOKIES & VOTING SYSTEM ===
- After shipping, project reviewed by Shipwrights (invite-only team)
- Then goes to voting stage where other Hack Clubbers rate with up to 6 stars in 3 categories
- Each project receives same number of votes
- Users also vote on others' projects (must complete certain number of ratings before receiving their cookies)
- Unfair voting is penalized

COOKIES:
- Minimum 1 cookie per hour tracked
- Multiplier up to 30x based on peer rating (average is 10x)
